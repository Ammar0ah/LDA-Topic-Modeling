          " formulasone one time I was fishing and I caughtfour fish and because I'm a math doorguy I" \
          " made a table table of it if youdon't do that anyway here's one exampleof a function very easy function here'smy fishesI think it's that's fish fish caught andthe number of pounds that they were somy first fish second fish third fish Igot for that day first it was 3.2 poundsnot badnext was 1.4 then 2.8 and then I caughta massive bass for 7.3 good day good daythermo back first thing let's definedwhat the inputs and outputs are for thisparticular well this would Morgan seemto function just a second first thing myinputs are well the fish that I caughtin this instance the outputs would bewell their weights when I weighed thembecause the scale would be like myfunction right and put my first fish onthere it'd give me a weight my secondfish on there it'd give me a weight nowthe question is is it a function is it afunction does each input does each fishhave one specific weight yeah okay ohyou know what I need to race somethingright here one exactly one not uniquebut one output unique output would be aone-to-one function and we're not thereyet so when we say it has one output Imean that that I don't have fish numberone weight three point two pounds andfour point seven pounds because you'dsay how much is your first fish way I'dsay three point eight or four threepoint two or four point seven would thatmake sense to you well no seriously howmuch the fish weighed three point two orfour point seventhat doesn't make any sense or give metwo blades for the same fish does thatmake sense to you would that make senseif you ask me that question how much isyour first fish way I said oh welleither 3.2 or 4.7 they said we talkedabout your first fish yes we are leave104.7 feeling well if I'm having dinnerwith you tonight I didn't know if I'mgoing to be hungry after clutch accountsor if I'm gonna be satisfied 4.7 3.4what's up it doesn't make any senseright you have to get I have to give youa specific weight for that one fishthat's what a function does it says ifyou say fish number one you're talkingabout one specific weight okay maybe Ishould say the word specific output notthat unique is one unique output we willbe talking about one-to-one just alittle bit how about number two doesnumber two give me give me out just onewait yeah it doesn't say one point fourand then something else over here thatwould not be a function so this thing isa function any any fish that I have ithas one specific weight that we'retalking about if I did this would itstill be a function fencers yeah yeahwould be a function this way this fishfor weighed 3.2 pounds not somethingelse it doesn't matter that these thingsare the same that can happen let me giveyou a for instance as far as our graphgoes that right there has the sameoutput it again several different spotsright that would be some sort of an xsquaredit says if I'm at this point or thispoint I still have the same exact outputthat that's okay this is still afunction we're going to have a verticalline test - it's a function it would bea one-to-one function when passedhorizontal line test but it would be afunction we can also talk aboutfunctions really we don't see fishcaught normally we see some sort offunction like this especially if you'redoing a mathematical modeling you mightsee this where you have a set of inputsour X's you get a set output outputsthat thing would be a function every oneof our inputs or X's has one output howyou would say that it wouldn't be afunction if you came back and didsomething like this would that be afunction no no if your inputs arerepeated with different outputs wellthen you don't have a function there sothat would be a no buenostop sometimes that you have formulastoo there are our functions ah this is afunction what is that sure and it's afunction because if you give me a radiusit's going to give me out one area isn'tit so our area depends on the radius youhave your circle it's not like I say youhave a radius of three what's your areaand you give me two different answersthat would make any sense it wouldn't bea function of the formula to fail alsowe can have some graphs graphically ifwe did something like that we can havewe can represent them lots of differentways some basic tables here formulaswhich we spend most of our time informulas and graphs that's another wayto represent functions just one one notefunctions have to have only one outputfor each input that's the key thing Ihope you got that from from this now onemore thing about this one let's say wechange it just a bit and we say y equalsf of X could you find f of 0 what wouldthat mean to dothat mean if Y is f of X what says y isa function of X I'm asking for F of zerocan you tell me what is f of 0 in thiscase agent ok it is how much - becauseit says you go over to the input of 0you look up the output for thatparticular input so here it says findyour input remember this f of X right sogo to your X go to 0 10 without put isoh it's - how about F of 3 what's the Fof 3 and buddy that was everybody I'lltake it anywayyeah it just says you go to your inputof 3 you find out what that output wastypically we'll use this in this a badsituation where you have some sort ofequation y equals 3x squared minus 4xplus 2 the y equals thing isn't alwaysthe best for us to represent a functionthe reason is because in this classwe're going to look at a lot ofdifferent functions at once and you wantto be able to distinguish between themif I have just y equals a function theny equals another function y equalsanother function I say look at thefunction y you're gonna be like there'sthree of which we talked about we oftenuse this type of notation to distinguishbetween them so if I said instead of yequals F let us our y equals thatfunction I want f of X or G of X or H ofX that way we can just winks distinguishbetween those graphs and those formulasand these equations also what it lets usdo is if I ask you to plug in a numberit will tell you inherently what numberyou plugged in for instance if I say foryou here can you find me f of zero wellwhat is f of zero do what's thatsupposed to do for you so let's plug inokay so so plug in zero and find outwhat the output is can you plug in zerohere thank youokay so second okay so you plug in zerozero and you get the two what's niceabout this is if you plug in two fromthis one well you're going to get yequals two what does this tell you whatyou plugged intoget the - no no does this one tell youwhat you plug in get the - yeah thisactually will give you a coordinatepoint and say you plugged in zero yougot out to mess contacts this is oneother reason why we use that functionnotation let's go back to those graphs -can you tell what is a function just bylooking at the graph so for instancefor instance can you tell me whetherthese things are functions are not justby looking at them we know we can tellwith the tables right because if we haveI can put repeated with a differentoutput well that says it right therewe're going to be able to tell formulaicway just a little bit but right herejust by graphically what's that thingcalled where you test a line to seewhether or not it is a function or notyeah we have a burden like this imaginebless you by powerful ones like a sneezegrenade going on um Steve's grenadethat'd be so gross that's where my mindis right now okay so if you imagineevery vertical line it's supposed totouch your graph only one spot if ittouches it all so is this thing afunction for sure every vertical linehits this dying only one spot so yes thefunctionhow about that one is that a functionhat Brad was our basis with our basicfunctions every bird of mine is this isit a one-to-one function do you knowthat one do one function would be thehorizontal line test saying that everyinput has one unique output so itdoesn't happen again this is notone-to-one but it is certainly afunction now what this one is this afunction sure now what about this is aninteresting case what about this one isthis a function now does every verticalline hit the graph it at most once yeahyeah now a couple people get hung upbecause I've wait a second don't youhave to have something at this pointzero and that's there's no not everyinput has to have an output but if itdoes it only happens once do you see thedifference there this doesn't have anoutput is undefined zero this would belike 1 over X but if it is defined thenthat definition has to be one exactpoint to be a function so yeah this isstill a function how about this oneno this fails it because if you plug inthis point you actually get one twothree points out we can't deal with thatso this is not a function so a verticalline test verbally I'm not going towrite it down because I know you allknow it says that you imagine everypossible vertical line that verticallines have to touch every point of thatgraph at most one spot sort of touch thegraph at most one spot it can't evercross over more than one spot good howmany will be okay with our very quickintroduction to functions so far youhave a fun yet Joey Joey Joeywell let's consider one more thingwhat is that say 11 circle did you allknow is a circle did you read thesection on circles I adultage I did readset read circles right in to readcircles hopefully read circle pad as acirclewhat's it centered at centered theorigin very good 0 0 the way you shiftcircles around hopefully remember thisfrom your intermediate algebra base isyou have some parentheses in here like Xminus age and y plus K that would thatwould shift that aroundokay what's your radius good because weknow rate this is the radius squared soit remains to be 5 is it a function isit a function why not well yeah I meanvisually we know it's a circle righthere that's circular reasoning isn't itThanks where's my drums it's a circle soit's not going to pass the vertical linetest that's one way we define that weactually graph this it's a center zerozero radius of 5 it looks like this it'scertainly not going to pass over theline test however can you see itformulaic ly as well specifically canyou solve this for y and see that thisis not a function let's try that howwould you solve this for y would you dofirst okay so probably isolate the Y getthe x squared over there somehow youknow you're going to get Y squaredequals 25 minus x squared true now Y isnot completely isolated what would wehave to do to get Y all that so let's dothat so if we take a square root ofcourse that means both side that'sillegal to do on the left hand side weget Y on the right hand side tell mewhat I'm forgetting right here oh ohyeah every time you take a square rootof something you got to have a plus inmind so if the square roots on yourpaper no big deal but if it's not thereand you put it on your paper like we didup here right we didn't start with thatsquare root we and we introduced it tothe problem when you do that youabsolutely must have a plus or minus doyou see the situation now I want you totry to plug in a number and tell me howmany answers you get outwe help that you get out how many you'regoing to get yeah because if you plug insomething like I don't know4 you're going to get 25 minus 16 rightright you're going to get 9 the squareroot of 9 3 but then you're going totake plus 3 and minus 3 that's givingyou those two those two managers as soonas you have that out of a formula it'snot a function now the question is couldyou work with it to look at parts ofthis function and that answer is yeahabsolutely if we define this a littlebit differently if we say well let'scall f of X the square root of 25 minusx squared and G of X the negative squareroot of 25 minus x squared now let mesay question is this a function yeahsure is this a function it togetherthey're not a function but separatelywhat we could talk about each piecethat'd be finewhat would this be the top half or thebottom half of the circletop half bottom half then we can talkabout them but altogether when we lookat that thing certainly we don't have afunction there the other types offunctions we need to talk about one ofthem is called piecewise functionsbefore we go on to that are there anyquestions on for the wine test or whatwe're doing over here kind of justshowing that all formulas aren'tfunctions I mean we don't have thatnecessity when we solve them though wecan't talk about pieces of in thisfunction so you guys all with me on thisso far you ready to talk about piecewisefunctionsJoe you sure sure all righthere's what a piecewise functionbasically okay seen a piecewise functionbefore okay I know you have supposed tobe in this class you've seen before onevery basic piecewise function we do asecondthe idea is though with piecewise ingeneral that the formula depends on thevalue of x so the formula for thefunction depends on what value you'retrying to plug in so piece of I supposeis worth where the function changesdepending on the value of x your inputlittle over here some roomthe most simple one I can think of andit is really a really simple one thatpeople introduce piecewise functionswith someone you deal with a new it'sprobably since seventh grade sixth gradeit's the absolute value function what'sthe symbol for absolute value what doyou do with that markyeah the vertical lines okay so if I seethe absolute value of x what doesabsolute value do yeah that's right andsome other people you said what to dolike more applicable what do you do withthat if I put a number in there I sayabsolute value find what's absolutevalue five okayand I say absolute value of negative 12and you tell me it's one it's a distancefrom zero we're counting over what doesit do what does it do okay so makeeverything be more specific you actuallyhave to say this in two parts rightbecause one's already positive so whatwhat does it do if the if the number ispositive doesn't change it no okay ifthe number is negative doesn't change itso you tell me that this function doestwo different things depending on whatvalue X is that's really what you tellme right if X is positive I leave thenumber of low if X is negativewell I change that sign somehow does itmake sense so really we can define thisas a piecewise function if we say okay fof X is absolute value of x squared it'sreally hard to think about that as faras a graph goes I mean you might knowwhat the graph looks like but how wouldyou say you might have memorize that youknow the graph of absolute value X lookslike yeah sure with your hands how itlooks don't throw up gang signs nice kidno it's yeah it's a V now why how canyou get that from this you can't youhave to either plug in numbers andfigure it out or you have to define itpiecewise here'sa piecewise definition looks has thatfunny bracket that says all this stuffgoes together and then we have to findit on a piece by piece basis here's whatthe absolute value does it says you'regoing to do something if X is less thanI'm sorry greater than equal to zero youcan do something else if X is less thanzero some people define it as strictlygreater than strictly less than and thenwhen x equals zero itself or in thefinal exams what do you do if X isbigger than zero do you have to changeit at all now like this five right youdon't have to change the five you justpretty much drop down to value so weleave the X alone if it's bigger thanzero what do you do if X is less thanzero changes you say what no okay so wechange the signyou said negative x that's one we canchange it right if I did this and saidhow do I get from negative twelve totwelve what math did you do magic I didmess it up Harry Potter's my god I didMagic Mountain natives gone right thereall rightVoldemort I'll show yours boss too muchwhat this really says is you have tofind some math way to change a signedonly math way we have to change thesigns either multiplied by a negativedivided by negative so absolute valuenew year 12 really says follow thisformula and says you take the negativeof negative 12 does that give you backpositive 12that's the piecewise definition rightthere that's it that works it works forin fact you can follow these directionsfor your piecewise function will tellyou this part to use now of course weknow this one from a long time ago butcan you see that this is the definitionof that this would do it every timewhat's kind of cool is that anypiecewise function can be graphed byusing their pieces so we're going to dothat nextyou can graph any piecewise function bygraphing each piece individuallythe only thing you have to be concernedabout is that you use the appropriaterange that's really it so we're going totap on just a little bit you can grapheach you can graph piecewise functionsby graphing each piece individually butyou have to do it for the given range sowe're not going to graph the whole lineof FX equals x we're just going to do itfor it for a little bit of itnow let me use that word domain let'sgive that a tryso here's what we do with refugees Isuppose I'll write this out a little bitfor you when we get to a more advancedexample but for right now basically whatyou do you ignore one of these functionswhen these pieces you grab this wholething and you race it for the parts thatit doesn't actually exist so what I nowwant you to think of the the line f of xequals x how does that look what does fof X equal x look like sure you can doit with slope intercept form what's theintercept this is in MX plus B form yesokay the plus B will get zero so we knowit's crossing at the origin what's theslope of that so it means it's going up1 over 1 so if I were to graph thiswhole thing this right here is f of xequals x agreed the problem is is thisright right now the whole thing wheredoes it actually exist and thedirections will tell you that where doesit exist to the right of the Y or to theleft of the y donal speaker wants towrite y xi like come on you everywhereyeah that's because we're looking forthe X's that are positive these X's arenegative it's saying it doesn't existover here so we'd erased that part thatdoesn't even make sense so right now weknow this is the X where X is biggerthan bigger than or equal to 0 that'swhy we have this closed circle therebecause of the equality that includesthat little piece since we graph thatpiece already let's go down the nextpiece negative X just takes that makes aslope the different way staying underSun since we know this already has thepiece of a graph we can't put anythingelse otherwise it won't be a functionwe're leaving just like that that'swhere you get your your ravit from thisis the f of x equals negative xare you ready to try something just alittle bit more advanced can we do thatguess have any questions on the absolutevalue you've all seen this before yeslet's see if we can sketch something alittle bit funnier it's fun word I'm amath teacherthat's a sputter I guess I should knowwords rest upthat's betterare you ready we're going to wrap thispiece by piece now here's a little hintfor you what you want to do break up therecipe the domain first your x-axisfirst an appropriate ranges graph thepieces that will work out for you sowhat I'm looking at first is where thisstarts and stops I look at the keyintervals here the key intervals arewhat's what's one point that I'm goingto have on my ground where's the X startand stop zero is not up there don't careabout the zero I care about the negativeone because that's where we're going totrade off between one piece of it up andthe next piece do you give on SamI want this I want you to find theplaces or you're switching betweenfunctions one place is a negative onewhere's the other place sure here's whatour directions say piecewise functionshave directions it says for a certainrange that's less than or equal tonegative one so everything over here I'mgoing to be doing something betweenthese two numbers I'm going to be doingsomething else after this number I'mgoing to be doing something else that'swhat how piecewise functions workimagine if you're okay with that now wejust grab the pieces making sure wedon't overlap these functions are thesethese intervals what happens when theX's are less than or equal to negativeone what are we doing for this range sowe've already broken up we're going togo piece by piece we're looking at thispiece right now which of the directionshas to do with this piece of animationthat is this this piece no this isbigger than one that's that's what'swrong way is in this piece this isbetween negative one and one so we'vegot to be talking about this piece in ifyou look at it says X is less or equalmake the one so we know where or thisway what do we have to graph for thisthis piece right 0 with 0 mean what's 0meanor is on the line good where this yequals here this which one this do youhave a last chance to this ever lastyear it would have to be horizontallisten if the whole improvement of thiskind of confuses you just right enoughfor me say that you have y equals zerofor a certain fit say you have y equalsthe square root of 1 minus x squared fora certain bit so you have Lionel'sexertion it's the same thing you're justgrouping all these together in functionand graphing them piece by piece do yousee them ok so this is the piece that'sworking where your X is less thannegative 1 or equal to it this is thepiece that's working when you're betweennegative 1 and 1 and this is a piecethat's working when you're greater thanequal to 1split it up if you have to but you needto be able to graph each of thosefunctions so can you all tell me nowwhat is y equals 0 look like that is thex-axis yeah that's a horizontal line aty equals 0 y equals a constant right wetalked about that last time that's ORSon line so we're talking about thisright there one question I have for youshould I have an open circle or a closedcircle here and why and why it's reallygood good very good ok check let's go tothe next piece the next piece worksbetween negative 1 and 1 now do you alsounderstand what what we might have tohave no equal sign here and what if Idid this it would not be a functionoverlapping if these were differentthat's right so you're never going tosee equals equals zero just for the samevalue I can see that so let's go and seewhat is that oh my gosh what is that doyou recognize itwe had it before on the board except thenumbers were a little bit different whatis that that's circle if you square bothsides you get Y squared over theremoonship if you added the x squared youget x squared plus y squared equals 1that's a circle it's centered where doyou think origin somebody else tell mewhat's the radius on this one guess ifyou have questions now that would be agood time are you okay that this is acirclehow many will feel okay that that's acircle you can see it if you can't seeit overage handy can see it don't raiseyour hand can you see it not so much ifyou can't see it I feel like oh mygoverness what in the world is thatsquare both sides you get Y squaredequals 1 minus x squared you add the xsquared you get x squared plus y squaredequals 1 now this isn't what we cheateda little bit we cheat because this isnot an entire circle the entire circlewould be that you clear that would givethe top half and the bottom half whatare we talking about the top half or thebottom half which one we're just the topso we want the top half of a circle thetop have a circle centered at 0 0 with aradius of 1 well that looks to me likeit's going from here to there it's goingto have an open circle right here butit's been closed in by the previousfunction that's kind of cool right wedon't have an overlapping point is itgoing to have an open circle or closedcircle here yeah again why why is itopen doesn't have that little thatlittle equals so we've got our firstpiece we get libels here we got oursecond piece of top half of the circlecentered 0 0 radius 1 the last pieceoh the last piece y equals x how we cando thatthose eggs what's y equals x look likeokay okay so normally we would just havea dagger line yeah we might alreadygraph that's right here so if we regretthat we'd have this thing indeed throughthe origin it would it would go throughthe point 1 1 wouldn't it because whenyou plug in 1 you get out 1 so I knowthat it's going to go through that pointand in fact it's going to be solidbecause there's an equals there so if Iwere to graph it it would be thatdiagonal however I can't have it exist Ican't have it exists over here becausethis whole thing wouldn't be a functionwe're talking about just the piecethat's that way so I'm gonna extend thatline erase this piece because I can'thave it thereI've already got my piece in thefunction for that part that range thatinterval this is a little that's thepiece of the function they're kind ofcool-lookingbe able to understand it can you followhelp me feel okay about that good sopiecewise delineate your delineate thatx-axis by the appropriate intervalsgraph each piece to get down oh coolbut last thing we're going to talk aboutfor this section we're going to talkabout domain and range more about domainand range hey when I say domain to youwhat do I mean if I talk about thedomain more important more general thanjust X or from using different variableswhat does don't leave some over herewhat does domain me yeah inputs yeahabsolutely rightso when I'm talking about domain what wemean is all the values you can inputinto a functionand yeah you're right they're usuallyexits typically let's turn in with likea position function then you're talkingabout timeif domain needs all the inputs what doesthe range methese are using your Y values or your fof X or whatever function routine nowmost cases we have some sort ofconstraint and realize especially wehave some sort of constraint on thedomain let me give you a couple exampleson this let's say that then I give youan example here the area of a square thearea of a square now the domain is allthe lengths of the sides of the squarethat you could plug in to this thisfunction and get out an appropriate areacan you tell me if there's any problemswith numbers I plug in here for instancedoes s have to be it is s restricted inany way if we're talking about actualsquare decides do you have to be thesame but I'm talking about why can't itbe negative because in real life thereis no negative side sure in the formulayou could plug in negative 3 could checkto be not but in real life can you todraw me square right now with the sidelength of negative 3 can do itdraw me negative 3 you can do it rightthink you are going to make a squarethat has when you measure on tapemeasure it gives you negative 3 thatdoesn't happen because we don't measureactual distances and use of lengths ofnegatives so we'd say here yeah the areaof every square is s squared but we havea restriction the side length has to begreater than or equal to 0 you couldhave a trivial a trivial area trivialsquare here it is that's it at zero areaokay no no length of the sides you get azero length but you can't have anegative that's impossible we also couldhave some formulaic restraints like thatonethat one y equals 1 over X is there anynumber I can't plug into that sure whynot because your teacher the first timethey showed you're practicing now whatnumber can't be divided by like zero mygo good job Johnny you got it rightnever told you why right but you can'tdivide by zero any other number is goingto work positive negative you're finebut zero how about this one f of Xequals the square root of x here wecouldn't have x equals zero can I have xequals zero there can you plug in zeroto a square root yeah well let me askyou what's the square root of zero youknow then you can do it what can't youplug into the square root negative notinside so we'd say sure this has arestraint where X it could be equal tozero but it can't be lesson sir it can'tbe negativeotherwise we well in the real numbers atleast I'll let me make a littlestatement there if you're talking aboutcomplex numbers can you do itsure yeah you have an i but if we'retalking about complex number I'm sorryreal numbers and graphing them on a realnumber system well we can't now what wewhat we know is that we're going toredefine domain just a little bit Idon't know if your book does this or notbut how we define we're going to find amain a special in its class called thenatural domain the natural domain isbasically everything that works in thein the formula including the maybenatural restraints of the the problemlike at the side length of the square orthe formulaic restraints of like asquare root 4 divided by zero so naturaldomain basically means everything thatworks in your formula for your functionall values that work in the formulawhich guys like to do some examples offinding natural domain or domain ingeneral I was hoping you'd say yesnatural domain asked this question itsays are there any problems withplugging in numbers basically so let'slook at real simple one we got f of xequals x cubed it asks is there anythingthat you can't plug in that you can'tinput into that can you think ofanything can you plug in positives canyou plug in 0 you know can you plug innegatives are there any problems you canthink of can you plug in fractions I'msure you plug in anything you want ifyou can plug in anything you wantthere's no problems what we do is we saydomain is simply all real numbersOhfor those of you who like to be verysymbolic you can do it differently youcan say X is an element of the realnumbers that's another way to say sothere's no problems there that says thatyou can plug in any number within thereal numbers you'll be just fineI'll put that one can i plug in anynumber I want to this problem and getsomething out of it that's reasonablethat's defined okay now can i plug inzero yeah yeah even though we can zerothem down if I plug it in well I'm notgetting zero in the denominator whatnumbers can't I plug in one I'm sure nowyou do this in your head but I want toshow you here's how you find domain ingeneral you look for situations whereyou could have problems those situationsare roots square roots specificallymaybe fourth roots and denominators tofind out what your domain is reallyhere's what you're doing in your headyou're saying I want to make sure that Iknow that if this denominator is equalto zero I've got a problem here now thezero product properties going to come upwith your answers it says I know X minusone could possibly equal zero and giveme a problem I know that X minus threecould possibly equal zero and give me aproblem if I solve those I'm going toget your answers of one threemathematically that's what you're doingright here you guys see see what you'redoing you're saying I can't plug in oneI can't plug in three because if I doBAM it's going to give me zero and evenif I multiply it by something it's stillgoing to give me zero and I can't havezero on the denominator of any fractionso by setting a denominator equal tozero or not equal to zero is how I usedto teach in some other classes you cando this too I know it can't equal tozero therefore that can't be zero thatcan't be zero and these two things Icannot have X equal to zero that'sanother way you can do it by settingthat equal to zero solving it down youfind out your problems within yourdomain for denominators so here we'd sayX is all real numbersexcept or but X does not equal 1 and Xdoes not equal 3 please don't ignorethat does not equal because if you dothis I know I just use the equal signthat's what a lot of you in practice aredoing for your math crews but if you dothis except x equals 1 and 3 that says 1does work do you see that we have 2 notequal 2 so once you find those problemnumbers with it not equal to we're goingto find out later that what these thingsare if you cannot simplify them out ofyour function those are going to beasymptotes vertical asymptotes so thisis not going to be defined at x equals 1it's not going to find X plus 3 thoseare either going to go up like thatlooks like Andrew my dance moves butthat's Linder they're going to go up atinfinity down and finish something likethat just real ok with this particulardomain let's try a couple more I want toget through a few more problems here okhow about this onehow about 10x is that defined everywheresign goes like this right and cosinegoes like this does tangent go like thisthat's tangent go it makes those thosekind of weird s's of the snakes all theway down your paper why does it do thatwhy does it do thatLisbon wasn't a rhetorical I just dothatsure it's undefined why why is itundefined at certain points fill this inthat's a long time you remember I justtold you how functions aren't defined ifthey have denominators where thosedenominators equals zero we'll check itout if we if we look at this this istangent right if we set this denominatorI'm going to use the not equal to zerobecause we know we should not have thatequal to zero if cosine X can't be equalto zero just what I'm saying here whatvalues of cosine make it equal to zero- in terms of radians PI over 2 I everchoose one of them so X can't equal thisone these in this right here X can'tequal PI over 2 X can't equal if youkeep on going you're going to get let'ssee for you guys here's PI over 2 cosine0 true you can keep going to 3 PI over 2if you keep going around the inserteryou're going to get a lot of differentvalues it's going to keep repeating bothbackwards and forwards every PI fromthat so PI over 2 plus or minus PI K PIwhere K can be positive or negativeinteger - every part where tangent isnot fine because cosine will be 0 atthose points do you see why this thisworks the way it does you see why thetangent is not defined of those simplybecause cosine is not defined at thosepoints yet see that penny right doesn'tmatter if the numerator is equal to 0sine is 0 over something that's definedthat's ok but something over 0 that'snot okay okay last one we're going totalk about and then we'll call it a daydo I have any denominators here manydenominators anything over anything I'mgood as far as that goes but man I got asquare root so we're going to be havingsome trouble doing this square root whatdo you know about things the radicandthat's what's inside the radical what doyou know about the radicandof square roots they have to be theygotta be positive so when you deal withthese roots denominators I showed youhow to do that what you're going to dois set the denominator equal to zero ornot equal to zero solve that down thatwill give you your problems in naturaldomain as far as the radicals go youknow for fact that this thing is goingto have to be bigger than or equal tozero you know we're going to start thisnext time I'll show you how to do thatall rightso we're going to continue finding somedomains and some ranges of somefunctions now now basically when you'refinally what I said was the naturaldomain that's just really what works ina function what we got to do is look forour problem areas if we can define ourproblem areas that really defines whatwe can plug in and specifically what wecan't plug into a function really whenthat comes down to for us is you'realways looking for denominators androots if you have denominators you knowthat at some points you might beundefined give some roots there might besome ranges of numbers that you can'teven plug into your function so with usup here we're going to have an issueinside that root what do you know aboutsquare roots I think we might havetalked about this last time what do youknow about those what numbers can't youhave in there now can you plug in anegative here hey you might be able toprovide that when you work it throughthe radicand the inside your radicalit's positive that'd be fine really whatwe want with any root then a square rootwe want the inside part the radicand tobe greater than it could it be equal tozero is that okay to have a roof with azero inside of it sure so it's a reallywe want this if you remember from lasttime we had some denominators what wedid was we set our whole denominatorequal to zero or I even use the notequal to zero because it can't be zeroand you can solve it that way with theequal to zero finding out your problemswith our roots what we're going to do ismake the inside greater than orzero we're going to find out thoseranges at work oh my gosh that's aquadratic inequality that's math seethat's intermediate algebra days for youhow do you do that what would you do inorder to solve that problem factor wewould definitely have to factor at leastyou probably can see that because it's aquadratic right go ahead and factor thatsee what you getlet's seeyou said - three months - you'll getthat - you pass back to it scare butwe've been oh my goshalright how do we do the rest of itthough if we set each one equals zeroyou don't that's going to tell us it'sgoing to say that X is greater than orequal to three and it's going to saythat X is greater than equal to - do youguys see that which actually is notgoing to be the right thing for us Iknow you want to write because you're soingrained and saying make this equalzero make this equal zero by the zeroproduct property however we don't havethe zero product property because that'snot an equation that's an inequality ifyou know how to deal with yourinequality here's what you do you dofind the places where X would equal zeroyou kind of temporarily set it equal tozero in your head you find those pointshopefully in your head right now are thepoints x equals two and x equals threedo you guys see those points here's whatyou do with this this close a basicversion of a sign analysis test so weknow that x equals 3 and x equals 2 aresome important points for us here's whatyou do with those points I want you tomake up a number line put those pointsin order on your number line so whichone's going to come first for us goingfrom left to right sirthis is basically a graphicrepresentation of of your intervalwhat's going to work in your yourfunction here so knows what we've donewe've said okay we know the inside isgotta be bigger than or equal to zerowe've factored it we have some keypoints here we've got next one's three xequals two we put them on a number linenow here's how to determine when you'regoing to be okay in your function whenyou're not if you test a point for eachof these intervals how many intervals dowe have yeah it's like you're slicingbread right if you have a loaf of breadyou cut it once you get two intervals ifyou cut it twice you get three intervalsso you get three pieces of bread here wehave our three intervals if you testeach of those intervals with a point inyour expression here it's going to tellyou whether it's positive or negativethat's going to tell you what you canplug into your function and what youcan't so let's try this candy and you'llsee what I mean after we play our firstpoint can you tell me what is the pointto the left of two zero that's theeasiest one to plug in I want you rightnow to test zero so we're going to test0 10 0 on the inside of my function ifyou plug in 0 how much are you going toget 6 with positive 6 or negative 6 sowould you say that we came up with apositive answer yeah so this is going tobe a plus what that signifies is thatevery note right if you want everynumber to the left of 2 is going to giveyou a positive answer you with me onthat every have you tried one go for ityou can try to try to make it anynegative number that's going to give youa positive there do you believe me ifyou don't want to spend the rest of yourlife trying out numbersand come back to me I believe you whenyou're like eight years old and I'm deadyou might have a bet or somethingso we've tested every number over herewe know that every one of them is goingto be a positive the reason why we knowthis if you think about it it's aquadratic right and you just found theroots right it's actually an upwardfacing quadratic so it goes like thispositive positive positive dips down attwo negative negative negative comesback up at three positive positivepositive that's what we're finding outright now we want the sections that arepositive because we know we can onlyplug in positives and or sorry get outpositives for a square root that's theidea that's what a sign bounces testwill do for youhow about a point that's greater thanthree what are you going to try five orfour try it try five or four the onlypoints you really can't try are two andthree why what are two and three goingto give you yeah that was I can tell youanything right that's not positive ornegative try and try for right now youplug that in and see what you get youcan do in your head if you wantI don't really care about the actualvalue all I'm really concerned about iswhether you're getting a positive ornegative what you get and you reallyshould this is a quadratic it shouldalternate so you tested for and you'vegot a plus can you give me a pointbetween two and three because we got totest a point in there are two just tomake sure we have this right timetwo-and-a-half great try two and a halfuse your calculator if you wantventure million dollars give me negativedon't take the bed now it's quadraticright it's positive here it's positivehere it's got to be native there if itcrosses the x-axis so it's going to be anegative how people feel give what we'vedone so far so can you just set thisequal to zero and this equal to zero andget it right then that's there's no noand you can't because if you did thiswatch but you did X minus three isgreater than equal to zero and X minus 2is greater than equal to zero you'regoing to X is greater than equal tothree that's true what you're going toget X is greater than sorry greater thanequal to two that's wrong it's not agreater than equal to two it's actuallyless than do you see on our our graphthis tells you the areas that work rightit says I can plug in any point overhere and it's going to be okay becauseit's going to give me a positive andpositives are okay instead of squareroot some years only not you can't sendout right now this says every number Iplug in over here that's okay becauseit's a positive it's going to get thisis the insides going to give me out apositive and square roots of positivesare okay these numbers aren't so goodwhy aren't these numbers good when Iplug them in the inside part becomesnegative you followed if we have asquare root of a negative well that'snot so good for real numbers we can havethat defined so what this does it saysyour domain is all the intervals thatactually work and this is how you can doall of your roots if you have a functionwith a root and you're asked to finddomain well you do this you set itgreater than equal to zero and you workit out sometimes you might have to dothe quadratic with a basic sign analysisbut this tells you those intervals thatactually do work so take those thoseones that you know of and write aninterval notation can you tell me wherethis interval starts good and where's itend so negative infinity all the way upto two now I know that's going to be aparenthesis because infinities alwayshave parenthesis is this a parenthesisor is this a bracket why is it a bracketthat's equal to good it's equal to zerobecause if I plugged in the two it wouldgive me outzero right and that's that's okay for usand then to show any other interval whatyou do is you put this you stand for aunion I know the three is going to workall the way up to positive infinitythat's a different way and your booklikes to do this a different way todefine your domain instead of all realnumbers except you use the intervalsthat you can actually show so on yourbook sometimes instead of saying allreal numbers like I showed you last timethey say things like negative infinityto positive infinity you so have youseen that yet you would through yourbook that just means everythingeverything from the far left to the farright yes may I try another one did thismake sense to you okay cool okay let'sgo ahead and try to find a naturaldomain for thiswhat you ask yourself for domain is am Igoing to have any issues or basically doI have one of these situations do I havedenominators that could possibly equalzero or do I have any roots do we haveany roots here now we know any resistkind of nice you have to do this wholemess mess a crap right we do have whatthough what's going to be a problem forusgotcha nominator how we deal withdenominators domain issues withdenominators it is we set them equal toif you want to set equal or not equal towe know that the X minus two can't equalzero if we do we're going to getsomething that's undefined so right herethe way it is I know that X minus twocan't equal 0 which means X can't equalwhich number yeah that's problem so ourdomain would be all real numbers exceptX cannot equal to you can have all realnumbers but X can't equal to that'sthat's a deal now I want to show yousomething this is going to come backlater in our class when we deal withcontinuity check this outtrue different squares true is you cando that there factorstruecan you plug anything into that ifthere's no roots and there's nodenominators than yes you can can youplug anything into that but wait asecondthis came from a function that we knewhad a problem didn't it we knew we couldnot plug into there so what's it meanthat I can cancel out the problem canyou actually cancel out a domain problemwell that doesn't seem rightand the answer's no you can't so even ifyou can see listen carefully even if youcan simplify your function which you canhere you still have to keep the originaldomain otherwise you'd be eliminatingsome of those problems that you knowexists do did you follow thatsay one more time if you can simplifyyour function do it but you have to keepthe original domain because bymanipulating your function on thisparticular case you've actuallyeliminated one of your domain problemswhich that that's not right you have tokeep that original domain that says youcan't plug in two right just bymanipulated it you can't how that yousay hey no I can't Harry Potter here'smy math one done I can't do that so ifyou're going to do this thissimplification just make a little notethat with simplification you've got tokeep your original domain so our starour domain stays the same X still cannotequal two so for simplification keepyour original domainwith simplification keep the originalso to you another way this is how I waslike think of it you can't ever makeyour domain better by combining orsimplifying functions you can't evereliminate problems all you can do ismake more problems so how your functionsstart those are the problems are dealtthat's a hand you're dealt okay if youadd or subtract function together andcompose them the only thing you can dois create more problems you can'teliminate problems once you start withthis once you start with so if you havea domain with regular of this functionthat's the domain unless you mess it upeven moreyou can't ever make it better byallowing more points does that makesense to younow would you like to see what thisactually is do you want to see what thisdoesthat's as always yeah is it okay good Ihope so can you graph this can you graphthis in your head actually the answer isyeah these are the same graph check itout this graph right here is well that'sa y-intercept of 2yeah what's a slope run-run that meansyou go up 1 over 1this is X plus two this is the graph ofx plus two with no domain restrictionswe would say if I was just given thisfunction and I didn't know about thisthat's how I graph itnow what this function is what this oneis with your domain issue it says thatyou shouldn't be able to plug in the tworight if you weren't able to plug in twohow much would you get out of it plug in2 how much do you get out of it okay sowhat happens what this says is that whenI plug in 2 I should be getting out forhowever I know for a fact from myoriginal functionI can't plug in 2 because that wouldcreate an undefined situation in mygraph you with me don't zone out herewith me still so it says you can't plugin 2 what that means here is if youcan't plug in 2 you can't get out forthat means you have a hole that's whatthose are that what that is called inthe future is called a removablediscontinuity it's not continuousbecause you have to pick your pencil offthe paper so it's not continuous howeverit's a removable discontinuity which isdefined as if you allow one single pointto fill that hole if you can fill thehole with one single point it'sremovable so that's that's what weconsider that as so what are situationsin your denominator that there are twocategories I'll say it verbally but I'llgo over more in depth later if you cancancel out you know you'll have to usethose words cancel out it's really not aMathew word but if you can cancel outyour domain problem it's a hole herewith me it's a hole if you can't cancelout the domain problem it's an asymptotethose are two categories that makes itkind of simple doesn't if you can cancelout it's a hole if you can't cancel outit's an asymptote that's it and let mewrite that down for you yeahall right hoping I get away so let megive you another example before you youwrite that down I'll give you the sameone over here and I'll give you this onewhat can't X equal gear that's prettypawn gave you a very easy one so you cansee out of course X can't equal fourhere's the difference can you manipulatethis way to manipulate that's to get ridof X minus two if you cross it out thatmeans you have a 0 over 0 if you were toplug in the 2 check it out you're goingto get 0 over 0 right you see that whenthat happens that means you can cancelit out you can simplify it out of theproblem that's a hole for you so whenyou get 0 over 0 this is a hole likethatwhen you can remove the discontinuityaka week 8 when you can cancel it out ofyour problem was it always on zero overzero if it's a whole yes okay so youguys that is a test instead of goingthrough canceling sure that's a didn'twhatever number you're not supposed touse and if it comes to zero withpolynomial is absolutely okay radicalswould be very hard to factor that outmaybe I don't know how to do some workon the obvious matching with polynomialis absolutely though because if you plugin a number and it is a zero that'sautomatically a root which means you canfactor X minus that number out of yourequation that's math that's what'sproven so when you can remove thediscontinuity leaving you talked aboutcontinuity before but when you can movethe dome eight this means domain problemthat's a hole that's a hole zero overzero for polynomials in general when youcan just when you can simplify it out ofyour problem and it's no longer aproblem for your domain that's what wecall a hole it's just a little spotwhere you don't have a point now is yourhope you're okay with the idea of a holeokay now the other the other thing wegot to consider is well what happenshere can you simplify the X minus 4 outof your problem here is there any way tofactor it and simplify it if you plug inthe 4 do you get 0 over 0 no no you get1 you get 12 or 0 that's that's an issueright that means that you're not gonnabe able to factor that in any way to beable to simplify that what this is is avertical asymptotevertical asymptotesthis happens when you have a number over0 typically and it means you can't getrid of the domain issueas I say what things I forgot it thoseare going to come much later I'll showyou an easy with your dudx we're goingto talk about some of the myths doesthis outline better for you so you havetwo classifications to prevailing shoesif you can simplify them out therecalled holes if you can't that are goingto be vertical asymptotes we're going tofind out a little bit later on how todetermine what happens with those we'lldo it another sign analysis test beforeon our number line we'll figure out thatthese asymptotes came to go upwards ordownwards or a combination of those twothingsso they'll either be like this goingtowards form in this case or like thisgo into its form or like this takes alot of practice do that by the way andlike review billion had your head it'shard to do can you do that let's see nocameras not on you guys out okay nowlet's do one more example we'll go ontwo more examples to go into a wordproblem kind of figure out how we cantalk about domain with word problems andthen we'll continue on to some trigstuff so I want us to find the domainand the range of this problemfind domain and range of that problemhey first thing are we going topotentially have any problems in thisany problem what I'm asking you isbasically are there denominators or arethere roots are there any of those twothingsthere's definitely roots so wepotentially have some problems we don'thave any denominators so we're notdealing with poles and verticalasymptotes what we're dealing with isareas of our graph that we can't evenplug in a number because it's undefinedthe real number system you see thedifference there it's not even definedin those those areas now what do youknow about the roots how do we how do wego ahead and find those areas set thenthey could be equal to 0 right inside orless than 0 or greater than 0 that'd begreater than 0so what we know is that the 2 is this okand do anything the only problem wepotentially could have is the inside ofthis root because we know if this thingis negative that's not so good you okaywith that yeah that's so good so we knowthat whatever we do whenever you plug inthis has to be greater than or equal to0 that's a mustotherwise we come into a serious problemwe're not the real number system anymorecan you solve that how would you solvethat folks what would you do ed what ed1 this isn't even one of those quadraticinequalities is it actually prettystraightforward one this says you'regoing to be ok provided X is bigger thanor equal to 1 so for our domain you cansay one of two ways you can say ok thedomain is X is bigger than or equal to 1or if you want to use a little notationwhich again you're going to see a lot ofanswers like that in the back of thebook if you use interval notation let'ssay you're going from where to wherethank youthey can feed one now that would be Xwith you less than where you're the onewe want to be bigger than 1 1 toinfinity sure I know parentheses hereparentheses are bracket here should verygood giving preference on which we writethe answer I don't care you're going tosee this a lot right now as well do thatwhen could you not have it equal to 0inside a square root I'm gonna changethe problem just slightly so you see itif I erase that and put it over 1 700 orfor any number on the top this would bethe only case for it for your roots whenwhen you wouldn't have this equal to 0you see if you actually plug that in ifyou plug in your 1 sure you're going toget 0 but the square root of 0 is 0 andit's on the denominator so this wouldsay oh wait yeah even though that's asquare root I can't have an equal to 0because if I did the square root of 0 isstill 0 and that's on the denominator ofmy fresh all see the problem therethat's you now how do you find a rangewhat's the how do you get range how doyou get something in the range it is notput so what am Iwow that was a sneeze grenade oh my thatwas a sneeze rocket launcher allergic tocalculus and me too I start getting allamped up and excited anyway what are myinputs up here what can you input giveme an example that you can input inputone give me something else 3 someoneelse give me something any real numberbigger than or equal to one yes that'severything I can plug in now this sayswhat you can get out right just plug insomething you'll get out something sostart with the first number you can plugin and plug it in if you plug in what'sthe first number you can plug in plug inone what are you going to get out you'regoing to get one to two so this isstarting with two now take anothernumber any number plug it in and seewhich way you're going higher or lowerso pick a number in this domain againlike three or four or five see which wayyou're going where you'll pick out picktwo what's two gonna getor pick something easier than to pickten I don't care what you pick pick fivepick something like that pick five okaywhat's five going to give you oh thereyou goare we getting bigger or smaller thanthis so we know that this is good as Iplug in bigger and bigger numberstowards infinity this is getting biggerand bigger towards infinity so my rangegoes from two to infinity so how do youfind range when you plug in your domainwith limits we're going to find out howto do range a little bit differentlyright now you plug in your domain youstill feel okay so far yeah yes indeedindeed all right so let's try one morewe'll go on to our super fun wordproblem you guys Millard odd and evenfunctions another boy okay we'll talkabout two more things thenwe want to Maine and we want range firstthings first let's talk about yourdomain are there going to be any issueswith our domain here anything that wecan't plug in one what about naked oneis that okay we'll get 0 over negative 2is that alright to have 0 over a numberthat's fine that's 0 let's somethingover 0 that's not okay so for domain wego okay I know that X minus 1 can'tequal 0 so X cannot equal 1 well that'sthat's pretty clear so the remain is allreal numbers except X can equal 1 nowthe question I have for you is is thatthing a hole or is that thing andasymptotes what do you think if youdon't know here's how you check you plugin the number the two not supposed to beable to plug in it's like 1 if you getto 0 over 0 that means you can factor itout if they're polynomials and simplifyit out with another problem if itdoesn't give you that then you can't dothat you can't factor it out so plug itin you get 2 over 0 is that a hole or anasymptote definitely asymptotes so weknow we're going to have a verticalasymptote at that pointnow you can't really abbreviateasymptotes more than that you know whata burnt ass I don't know have you justhundred anyway how about the range helpthe range of this thing that's kind oftough right so you know the range iswell there is one thing you can do oncertain occasion this isn't alwayspossible uncertain certain things if youcan solve it for your X variable thenlook at those domain problems for your Ythat's actually the range it's kind oflike you're flipping stripped of theproblem so you can find the range bysolving for the independent variablethat's going to end then look at thoseproblems so if we were to do that she'sI don't even know if I want to do that Idon't really want to I guess I will Ican't want to I can such confident inthis longI made fun of the keep'em athlete incollege actually it's a horrible personin math League is cool do math Leaguegets fun I swear it really is somethingI was just I was too busy to otherthings okay to do that anyway do youhave problems here that's right yes ohyeah it is the same that's just kind ofweird that worked out exactly the same Idid this right trust me or you can foldit down this is correct but now that wesolved for X if you find the domain foryour wise that's actually the range ofyour function do you see the kind ofcool right you said well if we have anyproblems on our Y's that means we haveproblems in our range now what we'regoing to get out of the function what'sthe problem what can't you get outwhat's the problem here what do whatcan't you get out of this you can't getout one because why couldn't equal onedo you see how why can't equal one hereyes or no okay so if you do this wholeidea backwards and you you solve thisfor your independent variable and youmake it so you're kind of like you'refinding the domain of your dependentvariable Y or Y here that's going togive you a range so I'm ready to saywell now why I know Y cannot equal 1can you simplify out this domain issuewhich is actually a range issue can yousimplify out that then this is aasymptotes as well well it's not avertical asymptote what is it now we'regoing to have a better way to findhorizontal asymptotes in the futurebecause if you haven't noticed thisprocess for here this is really easy butfor every function can you always solveit for you're your independent variablenot even close no no that'd beridiculous so we're gonna have a betterway to do that in the future but forright now that's how you can find yourdomain and your range I'll be okay withwhat we talked about so far all rightyou ready for a word problem answersalways yes you're in for a super funword problem that you sure why not comeon you know you're not getting out of itanyway so you may as well enjoy yes itexists I'll prove it to you right nowlike this there it is look at thathere's what we're in the business ofwe're in the business of makingcardboard boxes what we're going to dois we're going to take a cardboard boxand make it by doing that's taking yourflat piece of cardboard and we're goingto cut out a square here here here andhere and fold up the sides will thatwork to make a box will you some tapearound the sides of the good-looking boxso very cheap way to make a box so ourour box idea is we're going to take apiece of cardboard that's 16 inches by30 inches and we're going to make a boxby cutting out squares in the cornersand fooling out the sidestell me what you know about the squarescan the squares be different sizes youhave a really stupid looking boxreally that's not going to send over sowell so if these are the same length allthe way around you're not gonna be ableto make your actual fold flat like shirtbox right that people like to use forpresents so I know if I call this X soin order to make my nice corner that'salso going to be X right but as soon aswe do that every other corner has to beexactly the same otherwise our box isgoing to really not be that great andyou're going to get fired from boxmaking how bad you have to be to getfired from box making that money come onnow I'm just kidding I'm guessing youhave to be pretty bad so we got thispiece of cardboard a 16 by 30 incheswe're going to cut out those corners sowe get this machine this you can comedown and then make it indented here herehere here we're going to fold the sidesup and increase them I think what theyactually do is they probably just madethem one cut and then fold the sidesover but you know we're a little moreadvanced than thatso our box when we're all said and donelet's see if I can draw this should looksomething like thisyou took a 3d Qi classoh no that should beokayhouse oh you guys are gettin way toomuch credit so if I'm folding this upit's still sitting the same way it'sgoing to be on this edge is this still16 inches longyeah because what I want to do is I wantto find a formula for the volumedependent on X I'll find a formula forthe volume depend on the size of the cutwe're making in in this this cars worthso find the volumeas a function of Xhow far is thatis it still 16 inches how much is it 16like 16 minus X yes anyway y 2x withyour Morgan yeah if we cut both cornersand fold that up we're missing not onlyone X but the other edge as well so if Iwere to find this yes I have a maximumlength of 16 right and if I subtractboth those those cuts I'm going to get16 minus 2x absolutely what that meansis how about this point what's that likesure we sell the same X right becausethey're squares so we're going to have30 minus 2x what about the depth of ourbox how much is the depth of our fourboxes death is X okay how do you findthe volume of a rectangular prism likelike this is x want to go inside saywhat makes it so as long as we multiplythose three dimensions we'll have thevolume so our volume should be okay wellwe know that one side is 16 minus 2x the2x again comes to the fact that we'recutting out two boxes from each side abox from each side and fold it up thenwe're going to get well that the lengthof this is 30 minus 2x and the depth ofthis is Xdo you guys feel okay on how to do thatby the way if you graph that could youfind out an approximate maximum volumeif you put that on your graphingcalculator if you did if you work onthat and plug that into the up or justplug in just like that you're going toget some sort of graph right it happensto be a cubic graph so if you found themaximum height for the domain that we'reabout to find out you can find outapproximately volume for that that'skind of neat right I think it's neat itis awesome let's talk a little bitthough about the domain are there anyissues that we are going to run intowith the values of x that we're supposedto plug in so firstly we got to checkfor any denominators are there anydenominators okay then that's okay thatdoesn't fill that part how about rootsto give me roots so we have no issueswith that how about some realisticconstraints though is there anythingthat I'm not supposed to be able to plugin for X because I'll tell you when youput that a graphic out that it's goingto go but no explain why why not anegative measurement yeah I can't tellyou would you make a box up please andput negative two inch cut in it thinkerit's imagine can you do that yeah it'snot gonna hold very much try to be flatlike here well yeahyou can't even do it you can't say makea negative cut out of my piece of paperhere that doesn't make sense so we knowfor a fact that X has got to be greaterthan zero for sure could X equal zerobut could it equal zerocould you make no cut here's your boxokay try to put a package in that yeahit could it could equal zero for sure isthere a maximum cut that we can make forour box so I know I can't make anegative but I can make a cut of oneinch and two is there a maximum to thatsixteen okay sixteen could I make a cutof 16 why not because I cut up your signwould that make a difference okay let'slet's also I want you to think aboutthat number per second so here's yourbox right and what you're telling meright now is if you have a maximum cutof 16 check this out this side like this16 right you're cutting out two squaresrun from the top and one from the bottomcan I cut out a square of 16 and stillcut out a square of 16remember this would be like a square of2 4 & 4 we go there if I take a squareof 16 it's the whole thing that doesn'tleave any room for the other square tobe cut out of it did you get that that'sa problem so let's rethink that ideait's not 16 here we can't do that what'sthe maximum length I could cut would be8 it'd be half that length because if Imade us I cut an 8 here I made a cut of8 here that would be the most I could gowithout overlapping if you overlap yourcutting stuff that's not there anymoreyes but you still wouldn't be able tomake a box out of that no you wouldn'tbut we weren't able to make a box out ofthis either so if we cut a Nate can youtake off that old piece of material yeahyour box if you did it from the otherside your box is going to look like I'llcut this side off and cut that side offequal amount that's not your box it's aflat piece of paper that's a muchsmaller you just waste all your materialbut you can do it right again you'd befired from box making but you could youcould do it that's our domain you got tothink about these things don't just gowith the formula I know we look for twothings in the formula with it fordenominators we also look for roots buteven if those things don't exist this isa realistic and straight you've got totake into account if you're doing withrealistic stuff you got to really thinkabout don't let yourself be triggered bythe 16 really think about what you canyou can't do with your product don't youknow if you're all right with thatokay now I wasn't going to do this butI'll give you a little refresher on someodd um jumplet's talk about audio even function forjust a little bit even functions arefunctions I have two four sixes andeights in them well that's notcompletely true but the powers shouldactually look like thatodds are usually the ones threes fivesevens what we say mostly though is thateven functions are going to be symmetricacross the y-axis odd functions aresymmetric about the origin which meansif you if you took them and you rotatethem hundred eighty degrees about theorigin it's going to make a mirror imagewith what you have already so for foreven functions here's what even meanslike algebraically are formulaic ly whenyou when you play some an even functionsays if you plug in a negative number ifyou plug in negative x for say it'sgoing to give you back out the functionjust as if you had paused looked in thepositive version that number so if Iplug in negative 2 or two it says itdoesn't matter that's even it issymmetricabout the y-axisnow audit functions say this it says ifyou plug in a negative number it's liketaking the function plugging in thepositive of that number and making itnegative that's what happens with theodd function so as if I was to plug innegative 2 it'd be like I plugged inpositive 2 got the answer and then madeit negative do you see the differencebetween these two things all right thisis this is odd and it's going to besymmetric about the originwhich I can see example of somefunctions that are evening on let'slet's line one up one eat like thatthey're asking for the mood today here'show you test whether something is evenwrong what you do is you plug in thenegative x and you see what happensso I have a big event what that means isthat for every place I have an X I'm nowgoing to put a negative X inside someparentheses it's like you're you'recomposing a couple functions okay you'rejust replacing X with negative x so thatmeans for this you'd say I want to seewhat happens with negative X to thefourth minus negative x squared plus oneso far so good don't use an actualnumber you only natural numbers use thenegative x is a singular work out foryouhow much is negative x to the fourth xto the fourth because the the negativealso gets to the fourth power right it'sgoing to go away to composite so this isgoing to become X to the fourth how muchis what was this going to becomeso minus x squared and then plus one didwe get the same thing back again exactlythe same thing back again yeah thisactually equals f of X if you plug inthe negative x and it gives you back outyour original function your f of X doesthat mean it's all it resembles eventhis is definitely even function andthat's how you tell this is going to besymmetric across the y-axis a mirrorimage G I bet you don't know what thisone can be I could trick it let's seewhat I want to do yeah again to checkAuto even you plug in the negative x yousee what happens so with with ourproblem we'll have G of negative x butthat says you're just going to take thatnegative X and plug it in everywhere DCX so negative x cubed minus negative Xjust like that notice negative x cubedokay we got itand the negative x takes that place that- still there regardless of what youplug in so that has to be there whathappens with this problem switch wellyeah negative negative X cubed is thatback to our positive x or do you get anegative x cubed out of that and thisone yeah that's for sure Plus here's howyou tell you the odd if your every termin your function is opposite of what youstarted with that means what you coulddo is you could actually factor this outif you factored a negative 1 you wouldactually get like that negative x cubedminus X do you see how if i factor outthat negative I'm getting back my Xcubed minus X yes no this is negative ofyour original function this is negativef of X negative that's my original signup oh sorry I used to have instead of Gshame on me Ohhi mark you have two points for that ona test I really do actually so becareful that um so that G of X when Iplug in the negative jinwu back younegative G of X that means it's even orodd what is itdefinitely valid if it's symmetric aboutthe origin usually s-curves electricsagain have a good understanding thateven on concept now if you lookcarefully we talked about today it allmakes sense"

A program that performs lexical analysis may be termed a lexer, tokenizer,[1] or scanner, though scanner is also a term for the first stage of a lexer. A lexer is generally combined with a parser, which together analyze the syntax of programming languages, web pages, and so forth."
